    "9 I saw a strange spirit in the forest ",
    "50 I failed to save Kendal.. I was poisoned by goblins.. and I was rescued by Oriana. It seems the poison is beyond her. That dream I had when I woke up in her hut was strange... who was that woman? ",
    "62 Gotzone and Zurene told me about the odd portal in Oisin forest. Apparently sorcerers used to fly freely from portal to portal, and even now one can travel between matching portals if one has touched both of them. I can't wait to try it! But where is the match for the Oisin portal? ",
    "68 The King instructed me to find the Mirari in Erromon, and advised that I seek their aid in curing my poison. He gave me a letter to give to the Mirari King, Txomin. First, though, I must find some companions to aid me in my quest... I really shouldn't leave on the trip until I get a party together. The Mirari live west of Gwernia, even further west than Oriana's hut. ",
    "85 Trahern asked me to look around for a valuable old sword. ",
    "19 Bowden hid Trahern's sword in a locked storage room off the lab. He gave me the key.",
    "87 I found Trahern's sword. Wow! He'll be happy when I tell him. ",
    "58 I found a bizarre camp south of the castle. It filled me with a strange feeling. ",
    "101 Oriana was visited by a powerful sorceror with a dark staff. She spoke of the Fourth School of magic, Necromancy. I'm very worried about her. ",
    "122 I arrived in the Mirari city of Erromon. ",
    "375 We met Becan today. I asked him to join the group. ",
    "135 I met a Mirari woman on the street today. She wants me to have dinner with her when I can. ",
    "142 I discovered that the Mirari also live in large underground caves. ",
    "145 King Txomin says that Master Healer Cradawgh may be able to help me. The King promised to help me find Cradawgh if I go fight the goblins for him. I have to go and fight these goblins. They are to the north of Erromon. ",
    "154 We killed the goblin king Kitarak. ",
    "166 Txomin lied! He didn't keep his promises. He didn't cure me, and now he wants me to go to Talewok. I could have done that before we went to kill the goblins. Maybe Gotzone and Zurene can help. I wonder if they are still in Erromon. ",
    "192 We had dinner with Yeraza. She says I have \"the scent of Chaos about me\", whatever that means. She told me to go southeast through the forest to seek Ardra in Talewok, and then go to Cradawgh's island. She gave us a magic branch and told me to lash it to my helm, so it would protect from harsh winds. ",
    "201 Today I fought some bizarre, misshapen creatures. I was scared. I wonder if they are related to the spirit I saw in the woods near the castle, or something else entirely?",
    "216 We are granted admittance to the Wizard's School. There is something weird about my name. ",
    "218 Ardra says that I must go northwest to the Dryads' forest and find something called \"amaranth\" before she will be able to cure me. ",
    "222 We found the Amaranth that Ardra needs to cure me. I shall be cured! ",
    "223 I saw a Dryad for the first time today. Wonderous...",
    "234 Pandara, the dryad Queen, likes me. She gave me an amulet which I can use to communicate with her once, and ask her help if I need it. I don't know why I'll need her help. All I have to do is go see Ardra and I'll be ready to go.",
    "239 Ardra performed a Crystal Vision on me. It was horrible! Such visions! She healed the poison, but things went from bad to worse! ",
    "240 I am worse than I thought. I have no True Name. I hope Cradawgh can help. I must journey to Port Saiid, avoiding Chaos and telling no-one who I am, and find a boat to take me to his island. ",
    "247 We met a squire named Arturo; I asked him to join the group.",
    "249 I met that strange spirit on the road again. It calls me \"rehtorb\", and speaks in riddles.",
    "265 We met Keelin today. I like her. I asked her to join our group. ",
    "274 In Saiid, their Lighthouse is dark. We need Magic to re-light it. We'll find a way. ",
    "275 Captain Amann will hire us his boat if we can re-light the lighthouse. ",
    "276 We found a scroll to help light the lighthouse. ",
    "285 The Lighthouse Keeper won't help us re-light the lighthouse, but he did give us the key... ",
    "5017 Lighthouse light is back on! The port is open! ",
    "287 A merchant in Saiid told us of a knight who blocks the road into town. ",
    "292 There might be some treasure in a cave near Saiid. It is underneath the city, some say. ",
    "295 We found a strange letter in a cave near Saiid. I don't know who wrote it, but it sounds weird. ",
    "297 We began our sea voyage to Cradawgh's Isle. ",
    "302 A storm forced us to land on a lonely forbidding place. Surely this can't be Cradawgh's island. That stupid Amann has to fix the thing before we can sail again. I wonder how long THAT will take. ",
    "309 We finally arrive at Cradawgh's Isle. ",
    "320 All my hopes are crushed. Chaos killed Cradawgh before he could name me. We must take his body to Ardra, to be buried in Talewok, and then seek Zaratas of the Jundar. Maybe he can help, but where can I find him? Don't the Jundar live in the desert? How will I find them? ",
    "343 Ardra tells me that I can use the Wizard's School Library. That's great. She also wants me to find someone named Tamberlain in Terminor. He'll help me, she says. Terminor is east of Talewok. We can find it by going along the road that paralells the ocean. I wonder what its like to be a dolphin? Do they think like we do? ",
    "362 I met the shadow-spirit yet again. It continues to ask that we \"join\"... but how?",
    "380 We met a mighty warrior-poet named Baird. I asked him to join us. ",
    "382 A fine fellow named Donovan joined us today. ",
    "385 I heard today about one named Mago. He, too, had no true name and he went mad. Will I go mad? I should find him, he lives somewhere in Terminor. Maybe he can help me. But he's Mad! I must be crazy for thinking that...",
    "390 Hope! A Wizard named Fyrsil who lives in the desert might have found a cure for Mago. He might be able to help me. When we go to the desert we should look for Fyrsil. ",
    "391 Tamberlain told us of some zombies controlled by a Necromancer in the Darkling Bog. ",
    "414 Today we saw the Darkling Bog for the first time. ",
    "392 We found those Zombies in the Bog. ",
    "398 A spirit named Elisheva used to haunt this area. He sounds like the shadow that follows me.",
    "400 Tamberlain mentioned that some Trolls south-east of here take money from travelers. We should go talk to them, they might know something. We can follow the road south out of Terminor. Does anyone know what I should do?",
    "399 We defeated the Trolls. ",
    "412 A wizard named Niesen will lead us to Shamsuk's tower. ",
    "425 There is some sort of wild man living in the Bog.",
    "429 We found Elisheva's tomb. Was he the other half of Mago? Is there another half to me?",
    "438 Today we arrived at Shamsuk's tower. ",
    "455 That insane jester, Farris, has joined our party for the trip to find Shamsuk. I'm not sure we can trust him, but right now we need all the help we can get. ",
    "458 Today we killed the evil wizard Shamsuk. Maybe he was lying about Oriana... ",
    "480 We solved the riddle of the Desert gate. Now we should go to Ugarit and talk to Zaratas. Ugarit is east of the gate, I think. ",
    "511 We know Lugash is buried underneath the Barrow. We have to kill him to get the Horn. ",
    "512 We know the Horn is buried underneath the Barrow. We have to get it so that we can command the dragon. ",
    "513 I know I have to find Fyrsil to bring about the merge. He'll know how for sure! ",
    "518 Today I spoke with the Jundar Emperor, Zaratas. Even he cannot give me a name! Only Rooughah, the Dragon, still has the power to do that. First I must find the Barrow, defeat the seven guardians and the undead king, and take the golden Horn of Kynon... I'm not sure I trust Zaratas, but do I have any choice? ",
    "523 A jundar named Sholeh joined the party today.",
    "548 I recovered Loden's sword, Fate, today. It's time to slay Lugash and take the Horn of Kynon. ",
    "533 The lich is dead. ",
    "542 Fyrsil never found the cure! But he says that if we get the Horn, I should be able to join with the ghost!",
    "551 I found the horn of Kynon today. Now I must find the dragon, Rooughah, so that he can name me...",
    "566 At last I have joined with my darker self. I feel so much more powerful... All that remains is to be named.",
    "574 A troubadour named Dougal joined the party today.",
    "582 Dougal died trying to steal the Horn.",
